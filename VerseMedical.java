/***
 Given a csv of cities (city_list.csv), use the weather api to find the coldest 3 hour stretch in the next 3 days for each city. The coldest three hour stretch is the three consecutive hours that has the lowest average (mean) temperature.

 Your solution should print:
 1. City Name
 2. Date and Time that the coldest 3 hour stretch starts
 3. Average Temperature for those three hours (in Fahrenheit).

 Notes:
 1. You'll use the "forecast" endpoint from weatherapi (/v1/forecast.json).
 2. You'll want to use latitude and longitude to search the forecasts
 3. Do NOT use LLMS or tools that write code (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
